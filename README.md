# 🎮 Finance Quest — Gamified Budgeting Adventure

Finance Quest is a modern web application that transforms personal finance and budgeting into a fun RPG-style adventure.

Instead of boring spreadsheets or strict finance apps, users complete daily money-saving quests, earn rewards, level up, and grow a cute financial pet companion — making saving money feel like playing a game.

## 🌟 Inspiration

Many students and young adults struggle with budgeting because finance tools often feel stressful, complicated, or unmotivating.

Finance Quest was built to answer one question:

**What if saving money felt like an adventure instead of a burden?**

By combining financial tracking with gamification, Finance Quest helps users stay motivated, consistent, and emotionally engaged.
